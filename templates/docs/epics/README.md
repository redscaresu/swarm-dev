# Epics

An epic is a goal bigger than one PR. It is scoped into stories (`docs/stories/`), each one PR,
and the epic is done when its last story merges; that PR deletes the epic file too. An epic in
`review` waits for a human to merge the PRs on its `prs:` line. `check:` is optional: a command every
story's builder runs from its worktree, and makes pass, before opening its PR.

# <Goal, as a sentence>

**Done when:** how we will know the goal is met — observable, not "stories merged".
**Out of scope:** what this epic will not do.
**Constraints:** ADRs, safety rules and budgets that bound it.
```

A story joins an epic with `epic: <epic-file-name-without-.md>` in its front matter; an epic made
from an HLD links back with `hld: <hld-file-name-without-.md>`. Scope a new
epic with `/plan-epic <slug>` (swarm-dev `docs/method.md` § Scoping an epic). In Obsidian,
`docs/Board.base` shows the board by status and by epic, and the epics themselves.
