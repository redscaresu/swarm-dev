# High-level designs

The top of the planning chain: **HLD → epics → stories → built in parallel** (swarm-dev `docs/method.md`
§ The planning chain). An HLD is written with the user, on the most capable model, before any work
is scoped.

File: `docs/hld/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — the day it was started, then a slug. No spaces: Obsidian
writes a space in a link as `%20`, which the link test cannot resolve. Start one with
`/hld <title>`.

```

title: <Title>

# <Title>

## Problem            what is wrong or missing, with evidence (file:line, runs, PRs)
## Goals              what must be true when this is done
## Non-goals          what this deliberately will not do
## Current state      how it works today
## Design             the proposal
## Alternatives       what else was considered, and why not
## Risks and safety   cost, production exposure, ADRs and gates it touches
## Rollout            order, and what can ship on its own
## Open questions     what is not decided yet
## Epics              filled in by /plan-hld, one link per epic
```

An HLD is `agreed` before `/plan-hld` decomposes it into epics; each epic links back with
`hld: <file-name-without-.md>`.
